# Ideas

## To implement

* The library should provide an API module that will allow other AI agents to use it to build emails programatically using the email builder.

* The codebase should somehow allow AI agents to test the frontend finding UI bugs and UX improvements

* We should have a documentation specifically for AI agents,so they would consume less tokens to complete a task

* Translation Framework
