### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Opening**

> "Hi, I'm [Name], and welcome to this tutorial series on the Visual Feedback System in Email Builder. Have you ever wished you could see exactly what a property change would do before you apply it? Today, I'll show you how our Figma-style visual feedback makes email design faster and more intuitive."

**[00:30-01:15] Problem Statement**

> "Traditional email builders can be frustrating. You adjust padding... and hope it looks right. You change colors... and cross your fingers. You modify spacing... and pray you didn't break the layout. There's a disconnect between the controls and the canvas."

*[Show: Split screen of traditional builder vs visual feedback builder]*

**[01:15-02:00] Solution Overview**

> "Our Visual Feedback System bridges that gap. Watch what happens when I hover over the padding control..."

*[Show: Mouse hovers over padding input, green overlay appears with measurement lines]*

> "See that? Instant visual feedback showing exactly which parts will be affected. The measurement lines show the current padding value. No guesswork."

**[02:00-03:00] Key Features Tour**

> "Let me show you the key features:
>
> 1. **Measurement Overlays** - Hover over any spacing property to see Figma-style measurement lines with pixel values.
>
> 2. **Color-Coded Highlights** - Different property types show different colors. Green for padding, orange for margin, purple for borders.
>
> 3. **Smooth Animations** - Watch how properties animate as you change them. No jarring jumps.
>
> 4. **Accessibility** - The system respects your motion sensitivity settings."

*[Show: Quick demo of each feature]*

**[03:00-03:45] Benefits**

> "Why does this matter? Three reasons:
>
> 1. **Faster Design** - See changes instantly, no trial and error
> 2. **Fewer Mistakes** - Know exactly what you're changing
> 3. **Better Learning** - Understand property relationships visually
>
> Whether you're a beginner or expert, visual feedback makes you more productive."

**[03:45-04:00] Closing**

> "In the next video, I'll show you how to use visual feedback for spacing properties. See you there!"

## Video 2: Working with Spacing Properties (4 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Master padding and margin visual feedback
- Understand measurement overlays
- Learn keyboard shortcuts

### Script

**[00:00-00:15] Opening**

> "Welcome back! In this video, we'll dive deep into spacing properties - padding, margin, and gap - and how visual feedback makes them easy to master."

**[00:15-01:00] Padding Properties**

> "Let's start with padding. When I hover over the padding control, watch what happens..."

*[Show: Hover triggers green overlay]*

> "The green overlay shows the padding area - the space between the content and the border. The measurement lines show exactly how many pixels. Currently, it's 16 pixels on all sides.
>
> Now watch as I change it to 24 pixels..."

*[Show: Type 24, watch animation]*

> "See how smoothly it animates? You can watch the space grow in real-time. This makes it easy to judge if 24 pixels is too much, too little, or just right."

**[01:00-01:45] Margin Properties**

> "Margins work the same way, but with an orange color. Orange indicates external spacing - the space outside the element."

*[Show: Hover over margin]*

> "Here's a pro tip: use consistent spacing values. Try 8, 16, 24, or 32 pixels. This creates visual rhythm. The measurement lines help you maintain that consistency across your entire email."

**[01:45-02:30] Gap Properties**

> "For flex and grid layouts, there's the gap property. This controls spacing between child elements."

*[Show: Gap property with multiple elements]*

> "Watch how the measurement lines show the gap between each element. This is perfect for button groups, image galleries, or any layout with multiple items."

**[02:30-03:15] Keyboard Shortcuts**

> "Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts:
>
> - **Tab** to move to the next property
> - **Up/Down arrows** to adjust values
> - **Enter** to apply
> - **Escape** to cancel
>
> The visual feedback works with keyboard navigation too!"

*[Show: Demo of keyboard workflow]*

**[03:15-03:45] Advanced Tips**

> "Here are some advanced tips:
>
> 1. **Compare before and after** - Note the measurement before changing
> 2. **Use the same scale** - 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px
> 3. **Watch the animation** - It helps you visualize the change
> 4. **Check neighboring elements** - Make sure spacing is consistent"

**[03:45-04:00] Closing**

> "Next video: colors and visual properties. See you there!"

**[02:00-02:45] Typography Properties**

> "Typography properties highlight the text content. Watch font size..."

*[Show: Font size change with highlight]*

> "The highlight shows which text will be affected. As I change from 16 to 18 pixels, the text smoothly scales. The visual feedback helps you judge readability at different sizes."

**[02:45-03:30] Workflow Tips**

> "Here's my workflow for choosing colors:
>
> 1. **Hover first** - See what will be affected
> 2. **Try options** - Test multiple colors with live preview
