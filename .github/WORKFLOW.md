# Development Workflow

## Session Protocol

### Starting a New Session
1. Read `TODO.md` to identify top priority task
2. Begin work immediately without asking questions
3. Assume user approval for the highest priority item

### During Session
- Work efficiently to minimize token usage
- Focus on completing the task
- No unnecessary explanations or pleasantries

### Ending a Session
1. Commit all changes with descriptive message
2. Update TODO.md if task list changed
3. Session is ready to be cleared

### Token Efficiency Guidelines
- Keep responses concise and actionable
- Skip acknowledgments and thanks (understood implicitly)
- Use TodoWrite tool only when truly beneficial
- Batch operations where possible
- Direct action over discussion

### Exceptions
- User explicitly requests different task
- User asks questions or wants clarification
- Task requires user input (ambiguity, choices)
